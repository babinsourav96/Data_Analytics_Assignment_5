This rich context makes it far easier to pinpoint and diagnose issues compared to basic print() output.\n",

        "  - Improved Maintainability: Logging centralizes the handling of informational and error messages, promoting consistent formatting and behavior across the application. This reduces the maintenance burden compared to scattered print() statements.\n",

Poor memory management can lead to excessive memory consumption, increased processing times, and overall slower application execution, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex operations.\n",

A memory leak occurs when a program continuously consumes memory without releasing it, even when the memory is no longer needed. This can eventually lead to system slowdowns or crashes.\n",

This can result in increased memory consumption over time and potential performance degradation or crashes.\n",
        "      - Performance Overhead of Garbage Collection: Python's automatic garbage collection, while convenient, can introduce performance overhead. The garbage collector periodically pauses program execution to identify and reclaim unused memory, which can lead to noticeable delays, especially in performance-critical applications or when dealing with large numbers of objects.\n",
        "      - Lack of Fine-Grained Control: Python's memory management is mostly handled internally by the interpreter, offering less manual control compared to languages like C or C++. This abstraction can make it challenging to optimize memory usage for specific scenarios or to diagnose subtle memory-related issues.\n",
        "      - Memory Fragmentation: Dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory can lead to fragmentation, where free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks. This can make it difficult for the system to allocate large, contiguous blocks of memory when needed, even if the total free memory is sufficient.\n",
        "      - Understanding Object Lifecycles: While reference counting is the primary mechanism for memory management, understanding how Python objects are created, referenced, and ultimately deallocated is crucial for writing memory-efficient code and avoiding unintended memory retention.\n",
